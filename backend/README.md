# ArtFusion-AI-Hub
## Project Overview
This is the backend part of a MERN stack project, built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** with **MongoDB** as the database. The backend handles API requests and communication with the frontend

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB/Mongo Atlas**: NoSQL database and deploy in Mongo Cloud
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication
- **Helmet / CORS**: Security enhancements
- **Jest**: For unit testing

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>= 16.x)
- MongoDB (local or using MongoDB Atlas) and Mongo Compress
- Git
- NPM

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and reset their passwords.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secured routes using JSON Web Tokens.
- **File Uploads**: Supports file uploads, optionally using AWS S3.
- **Security**: Enhanced with Helmet and CORS for secure API requests.
- **AI-image API**:Generate image
- **AI-video API**:Generate video

## How initial backend project

### JEST
npm run test

## Project Structure
The following is the structure of the backend part of the project:


### File/Folder Descriptions:

- **`__tests__/`**: This directory contains all unit and integration tests for the backend, ensuring that your code works as expected.

- **`controllers/`**: Controllers contain the logic for handling API requests and responses. For instance, they process data, interact with models, and return responses to the client.

- **`coverage/`**: This folder is generated by your test coverage tool (like Jest). It contains reports that show how much of your code is covered by the tests.

- **`models/`**: This folder includes the database models. These are Mongoose schemas that define the structure and data types of your MongoDB collections.

- **`routers/`**: Routers define the routes for the API. They link specific API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/users`) to the corresponding controllers.

- **`types/`**: If you are using TypeScript, this folder would store type definitions, which help in type-checking and enforcing data structure.

- **`utils/`**: Utility functions that are used across different parts of the project, such as functions for error handling, token generation, or other helper logic.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore (e.g., `node_modules/`, `config.env`).

- **`.prettierrc`**: Prettier configuration file for consistent code formatting across the project.

- **`app.js`**: This is the main application file where the Express server is configured. It typically initializes middleware, connects to the database, and sets up the routes.

- **`config.env`**: This file contains environment-specific variables like `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, or `AWS_S3_BUCKET`. Itâ€™s ignored by Git to avoid leaking sensitive information.

- **`package.json`**: This file holds the metadata about your project, including the list of dependencies, scripts to run the project (e.g., `npm start`, `npm test`), and other configuration options.

- **`package-lock.json`**: This file ensures that the same dependency versions are installed whenever the project is set up, locking the specific version of every package.

- **`README.md`**: The documentation file that describes the project, how to set it up, how to contribute, etc.

- **`server.js`**: This is the main entry point of the backend application. It starts the server, listens on a specified port, and serves the application.
